# data_manipulation_using_dplyr


In this repository, I have tried to summarise key functions of dplyr package which are often used for data manipulation

List of functions:


1. arrange()
2. select()
3. distinct()
4. filter()
5. group_by()
6. mutate()

along with some of the basic function such as : 
7. count()
8. sum()
9. mean()
10. sd()
11. var()
12. max()
13. min()
14. top_n()
